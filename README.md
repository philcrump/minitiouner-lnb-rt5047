# minitiouner-lnb-rt5047

This is a PCB for a 13V/18V LNB Bias Voltage supply, designed to be used with the Minitiouner V2 hardware. A single regulator is present however this can easily supply 100mA LNBs on both channels.

Inputs are available for Enable/Disable, and 13V/18V selection. An output for a "Fault" LED indicator is also available.

22KHz tone feature requires an external modulator, an input is available for this, however it has not been tested by the author.
